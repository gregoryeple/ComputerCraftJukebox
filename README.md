# ComputerCraft Jukebox

A revised version of the Jukebox program originally made by **The Juice**. ([Original Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerCraft/comments/9rqk6w/jukebox_110_info_in_comments/))

Added a loop button, UP/DOWN keys when the number of discs if greater than the height of the monitor and a few other tweaks.

Works with every music disc in the modpack **All the Mods 7** as of version 0.2.45.
